# Useless Box with ESP8266

A useless box made smarter with an ESP8266 microcontroller and an APDS-9660 proximity sensor to give more funny responses.

## Hardware

## Wiring

The wiring is designed to create a custom shield for the Wemos D1 Mini ESP8266 microcontroller-based board, instead of soldering the cables directly to the board. In this way you can easily assemble the parts or even reuse them in the future.

The PCB was designed with [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org), and you can [download the source file](./wiring/Useless Box Shield v1.fzz) to further customize it to your needs.

You can also [download the Gerber files](./wiring/Useless Box Shield v1 PCB Gerber.zip) which you can use to order the PCB from your preferred PCB manufacturer. (Note: I've created my prototype manually then documented it in Fritzing, so I have not tested this PCB yet.)


## The Box

I designed a custom box for this project which can be 3D printed or even further customized. You can download the model from ...
